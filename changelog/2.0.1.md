# little patch

other than just optimization changes, we removed the de-stringifying from the Globals class. originally, this was to prevent dictionaries passed to Globals from being saved as normal strings, though there were issues with Shortcuts' "Get Dictionary From Input" which made them invalid. so we're removing it for now

# happy 500!
before announcing this update i would like to thank yall for helping Cyclone reach 500 downloads. as of now, i dont know what to do for this event so if you have any ideas let me know via the feedback page or dm wheatwhole_ on discord. thank you users and developers ❤️

Additionally, im looking for anyone who still has the **ICEBOX Shortcut**. If you do, please dm me @wheatwhole_ on discord.
# organization changes
- the feedback page can now be accessed directly within the shortcut
# function changes
- **Shortcuts.QuickUpdate now has an option for downloading updates via RoutineHub URL or iCloud URL**. you will still need a RHID and Version number for both. The reason for this is you'll receive more downloads if people download through the RoutineHub URL. It will be RoutineHub URL by default.
- brought **dark mode compatibility for all elements** in Text.ToRichText
- fixed issue where Menu.Create would attempt to Base64 decode blank text

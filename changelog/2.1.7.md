# happy 500!
before announcing this update i would like to thank yall for helping Cyclone reach 500 downloads. as of now, i dont know what to do for this event so if you have any ideas let me know via the feedback page or dm wheatwhole_ on discord. thank you users and developers ❤️
Additionally, im looking for anyone who still has the **ICEBOX Shortcut**. If you do, please dm me @wheatwhole_ on discord.
# organization changes
- the feedback page can now be accessed directly within the shortcut
- **A new and much faster loader is out**
# function changes
- **changed Shortcuts.QuickUpdate to use RH url** so shortcut devs get more downloads 
- fixed issue where Menu.Create would attempt to Base64 decode blank text
- revamped the blockquote element in Text.MarkdownToRichText
- changed cache to be dependent on current Cyclone version. this is to prevent updated functions from being ignored if they're already cached.

## what is cyclone
Cyclone is one of the first function libraries in Shortcuts designed for **efficiency** in shortcut creation. It features global variables, shortcut updating, vCardMenus, stylized screens, and more, all with maximum customization and ease of use. **Simply pass a dictionary through this shortcut as an input and Cyclone will do the rest** 
Read the docs below or by running the shortcut

## features
- ✅ **optimized:** only runs what the actions it needs to. we’re always working on optimizing it 
- 🌎 **global variables:** set a variable that will remain even after the user stops the shortcut. Can be retrieved at any time
- ✨ **styled screens:** build a custom styled screen based on markdown with colors, font sizes and weights of choice. Loads in less than 2 seconds. Runs no external scripts, so external fonts are not supported (maybe in a future version) 
- 🧰 **dictionary utilities:** New useful dictionary utilities such as removing an item from a dictionary, or checking if a dictionary has an item
- ✨ **styled menus:** Styled Menus with images and descriptions 
- ⬆️ **auto updater:** Checks if your shortcut has an update available and if so, installs it with a stylish screen and menu with all the update info.
  - or, you can go advanced and make your own updater with Cyclone. don’t worry, we’ll check if the user has internet before requesting to update
- 🔒 **encryption:** top tier encryption for protecting user set passwords
